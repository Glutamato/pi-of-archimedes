# pi-of-archimedes

As part of the web course at NTNU.
Our assignment was to make a program that estimates pi using Archimedes method.
His way of calculating pi was to create polygons inside a circle and calculate the area of each side using Pythagorean theorem.

If we keep adding sides to the polygon, the more accurate our calculation of pi would be.

# How to run the program
  1. Navigate to the directory of the file using terminal.
  2. Type in "python main.py"
  3. Behold, our estimate of pi using the same concept as Archimedes!
